I am a Ph.D. candidate in Software Engineering at **East China Normal University**, Shanghai.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Formal Methods** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I am particularly focused on leveraging LLMs to enhance **model checking** and **theorem proving**, as well as ensuring the safety and security of AI systems through rigorous formal verification techniques.


Outside of the lab, I am an avid **fitness enthusiast**, focusing on resistance training and body composition. I also enjoy **hiking**  and brewing coffee with my trusted French press.
