I am **Xinyu Zhang**, a Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at **East China Normal University** in Shanghai.

My research lies at the intersection of **Formal Methods** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I focus on model checking, constrained Horn clause solving, and program verification, with recent work on LLM-assisted formal reasoning.

I previously received my M.Eng. in Cyberspace Security from **Guangzhou University**, where I worked on program-semantics-guided loop invariant synthesis, and my B.Eng. in Network Engineering from **Southwest Jiaotong University**.

Outside research, I enjoy resistance training and hiking.

### Research Interests

* **Model Checking:** IC3/PDR, CAR, BMC
* **SAT, SMT, CHC**
* **Program Verification：** Frama-c (ACSL), CBMC
* **AI4FM, FM4AI**
